# Run diffusion models on a Free Colab Tier

A collection of scripts and notebooks that show how to **quantize** diffusion models and run them on a **free tier colab** notebook. We will be using the `diffusers` library to handle everything diffusion and `bitsandbytes` for everything quantization.

## How to navigate the repository?

You will find notebooks or script starting with `[Quant]` which signify that they will guide through the quantization model. The scripts with start with `[Inf]` signify inference only guides.
